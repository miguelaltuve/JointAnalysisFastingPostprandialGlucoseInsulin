## Abstract

Aims: Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations in fasting and postprandial reflect the metabolism of glucose by the human body and are useful in the diagnosis of metabolic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance. In this work, these concentrations are jointly analyzed in Venezuelan women and 28 classes that better specify each metabolic condition are generated.
Materials and Methods: Each class comprises a combination of fasting and postprandial ranges of glucose and insulin concentrations defined in the literature as normal, impaired and diabetic. A hypothesis test was used to find statistically significant differences between the classes and confidence intervals for age and glucose and insulin concentrations were defined for each class.
Results and Conclusion: The process of deterioration of glucose metabolism advances with the age of the subject, that more than half of the prediabetics have impaired glucose levels in fasting but normal in postprandial and normal insulin levels in fasting and postprandial, and that one third of diabetics have diabetic glucose levels in fasting and postprandial and normal insulin levels in fasting and postprandial. This categorization of subjects would allow the application of a more specific treatment and the possibility of predicting the progress of the metabolic disorder.
